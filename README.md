# Getting Started

## 1.Setup Flutter

## 2.Clone the repo

$ git clone https://github.com/Samaritan1011001/Trovami.git
$ cd trovami/

## 3. Setup Firebase

1. You'll need to create a Firebase instance. Follow the instructions at https://console.firebase.google.com.
2. Once your Firebase instance is created, you'll need to enable anonymous authentication.

* Go to the Firebase Console for your new instance.
* Click "Authentication" in the left-hand menu
* Click the "sign-in method" tab
* Click "Google" and enable it

3. (skip if not running on Android)

* Create an app within your Firebase instance for Android, with package name com.yourcompany.locatePal
* Run the following command to get your SHA-1 key:

```
keytool -exportcert -list -v \
-alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
```

* In the Firebase console, in the settings of your Android app, add your SHA-1 key by clicking "Add Fingerprint".
* Follow instructions to download google-services.json
* place `google-services.json` into `Trovami/android/app/`.

4. (skip if not running on iOS)

* Create an app within your Firebase instance for iOS, with package name com.yourcompany.locatePal
* Follow instructions to download GoogleService-Info.plist, and place it into Trovami/ios/Runner in XCode
* Open Trovami/ios/Runner/Info.plist. Locate the CFBundleURLSchemes key. The second item in the array value of this key is specific to the Firebase instance. Replace it with the value for REVERSED_CLIENT_ID from GoogleService-Info.plist
